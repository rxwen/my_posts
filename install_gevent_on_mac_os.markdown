This post is for Mac users in China who wants to fuck the gfw.

The goagent has been rewritten based on gevent. Though it still supported to run without gevent, it's recommended to install gevent. 
  
It's pretty easy to install gevent on mac os with [brew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) tools.

1. brew install libevent
1. sudo pip install gevent greenlet
